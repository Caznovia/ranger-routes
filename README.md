# Ranger Routes

> The central source for *complete* Pokémon speedrun routefiles.

## What is a routefile and how do I use it?

Routefiles are used by [Pokémon Ranger](https://ranger.maybreak.com/route) to display IV trackers and dynamic notes for manipless Pokémon speedruns.

## What does this repository do?

All routefiles published here are searchable in Ranger.

## How do I create a routefile?

See the [Ranger docs](https://docs.ranger.maybreak.com).

## How can I publish my routefile?

First, make sure your route is runnable from start to finish and that Ranger does not give an error. You can test your routefiles by dragging them
onto Ranger. Your route doesn't need to be 100% perfected (routes can always change!), but it should provide all the notes needed to finish the run.

If you're ready to submit your route, [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repository and create a new directory with the name
of your route. Make sure the name does not conflict with any other published route.

Your directory should have this structure:


| File                       | Purpose                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `route.md` or `route.mdr`  | The routefile.                                          |
| `assets/`                  | A directory with the images used by the routefile, if any. |

For an example, see [white-2-manipless-lillipup](https://github.com/Corvimae/ranger-routes/tree/main/white-2-manipless-lillipup).

Finally, open a [pull request](https://github.com/Corvimae/ranger-routes/compare).
